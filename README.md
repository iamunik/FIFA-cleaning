<h1 style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px dashed">FIFA Data-cleaning</h1>
This project is a data cleaning project, it started as a challenge from two twitter accounts <a href="https://twitter.com/PromiseNonso_?s=20">@PromiseNonso_</a>; The challenge involved one very important aspect of Data Analytics or any data related field <b>"Data Cleaning"</b>, we were given a dataset that contains the details of FIFA 21 footballers, the columns in the dataset included an ID, name, positions, club, wage and some others, the task was simple "CLEAN THE DATA" utilizing any tool you feel like using of which I picked 'Python'. I took the challenge a step further and actually performed an analysis on the data and built a report using PowerBi, the report gives insight into the data, insights like; the club that paid the highest wages, the country that has the most players and filters that can help bring out other insights, etc. Attached to this repository is the Report and the Data Cleaning file.
